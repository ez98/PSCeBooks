    <p class="c" style="font-family: cursive; text-align: center">I created this website to share the books that I have used throughout my acedemic career at Prairie State College.
        For many students at PSC (including myself), paying for books was a bit overwhelming.
        I'd pay out of pocket for a book that I rarely ever used throughout the semester.
        Also, let's not forget that PSC is located in a low-income area and some students can't afford paying out of pocket for certain books (especially Math/Science books).
        Therefore, enjoy these free eBooks and share this website with your peers. 
        <b>Some professors want you to bring your book to class, so it might be a good idea to invest
        in a tablet/iPad. I personally invested in a $175 Samsung Tablet and professors were okay 
            with me bringing it to class. It may seem like a lot of money, but if you think about it; you'll be saving a lot more money in the long run!</b>
